# nasa-paper
A login script for macos to set your wallpaper to NASA's photo of the day.

## Purpose

A somewhat boring summer day brought about this simple Python script that changes the wallpaper to Nasa's photo of the day. 

## How to use

This only works for MacOS since it requires changing the system's wallpaper. I am running macos Monterey v. 12.0.1.

Simply clone the repo and insert your API key in the corresponding section of the code. The python script will then need to be converted to a shell script.
To do this, change the file ending to .command. Then add this shell script as one of the Login items in Users & Groups in Settings: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6442364/running-script-upon-login-in-mac-os-x

## Aside

I don't use this script anymore for two reasons, login items require the computer to boot up from being completely off, which I rarely do with my mac.
Also, different photos have different resolutions so sometimes the photos could appear too pixelated or too small for my liking. Perhaps there are ways around this, 
but I like my high-resolution forest background :)
